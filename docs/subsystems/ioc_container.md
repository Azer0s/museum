# IoC container (museum/ioc)

The `museum/ioc` subsystem serves as an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, facilitating dependency injection to manage object lifecycles and dependencies within the application. The main type in the package is the `Container` struct, which holds the registered dependencies and provides methods for managing them. The package includes functions for creating a new container, registering singleton and generator dependencies, retrieving dependencies, injecting dependencies into structs and functions, and generating a dependency graph for debugging purposes.

The `Container` struct uses maps and mutexes to manage and synchronize access to the registered dependencies. The package supports both singleton and generator dependencies, allowing for flexible dependency management. The `ForStruct` and `ForFunc` functions enable dependency injection into structs and functions, respectively, making it easy to manage dependencies. Additionally, the package includes a `GenerateDependencyGraph` function that generates a DOT format graph of the registered dependencies, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the dependency relationships in the application.
